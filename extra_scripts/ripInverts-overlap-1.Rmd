##Field data
Import previously prepared field data.  This comprises a series of sampling events collated by Jon Webb. 

Here are 10 random rows from the data: 
```{r, out.width=200}
field_data <- read_csv("../data/field_data_extract.csv")
sample_n(field_data, size = 10) #%>% kable()
```

Each species record is a row.  Columns are species name (`spp_name` and columns identifying the survey event.
